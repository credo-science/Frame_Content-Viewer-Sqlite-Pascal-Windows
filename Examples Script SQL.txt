Some sample scripts in SQL. I invite others to add my ideas :)


Summation script for teams in the League:
	SELECT  DISTINCT a.team_id as Numer_DruÅ¼yny, COUNT(*) as liczba_detekcji
	 FROM    detections a
		WHERE  (datetime(a.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch')> "2020-01-12 21:00:00" 
	 AND 
                datetime(a.timestamp/1000,'unixepoch')< "2020-01-13 9:00:00" )
	 GROUP BY team_id;


The script displays all detections for user ID 21362:


	select datetime(timestamp/1000,"unixepoch") as data from detections
	where user_id=21362


The script displays all detections for device ID 1312 with the condition of detection coordinates:


	select device_id,datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch'),x,y
	 from detections where   (device_id=1312) 



The script displays all detections with the condition of time interval and detection coordinates:

	select team_id, device_id,datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch') AS DATAK   
	from detections p 
	where   
		(datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch')> "2020-01-12 21:00:00" 
	AND 
		datetime(timestamp/1000,'unixepoch')< "2020-01-13 9:00:00" )  
	AND     (x<100 and y<100) or    ( x>width-100 and y> height-100)


A script that searches for detections at the same times: duplicates, triplets etc.


	SELECT datetime(a.timestamp /1000,"unixepoch"),a.device_id,b.device_id,a.frame_content
	FROM detections a
	JOIN (SELECT  device_id,  timestamp, COUNT(*)
	FROM detections 
	GROUP BY  (timestamp ),  device_id 
	HAVING count(*) > 1) b
	ON 
	( (a.timestamp)  =  (b.timestamp )) 
	ORDER BY  a.timestamp
